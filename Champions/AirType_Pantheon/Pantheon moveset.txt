Moveset for AirType Pantheon

Numpad 9/Page Up - Forward shot, 3 shots in a row with a slight delay

Numpad 7/Home - Diagonal shot, shoots downwards, hitting targets on the ground, no AoE damage


The character would be a good match against Vile, since it flies and is fairly mobile and could give all these Viles some hell bwahahaha.
